these war orphans claim to be the children of the raiders you killed and turned into leather hats. however, everybody knows there are no kids in rimworld. dundundunnn.. 

they're actually synth-noids (synth mechanoid infiltrators) they join to spy on you, then they eat your food and break your hearts. (they only eat human food)

lifestages :
-orphan : 0-4yrs (baby)
-waif/urchin : 5-9yrs (juvenile)
-maid/butler : 10-15yrs (juvenile late)
-lady/lord : 16yrs-above (adult)

they convert what they eat into chemfuel. 
milking them gives you chemfuel. they excrete it like vomit. (adult lifestage)

their mecha-organoid body sheds plasteel. 
shearing them gives you plasteel. like peeling tree bark. (adult lifestage)

butchering gives you steel, plasteel, components, meat, and leather. 
(proof that they are machines disguised as humans)

they produce mechanoid sounds while in combat. 
(more proof of their mechanoidness)

they are pack animals and can carry your stuffses when joining a caravan, so you can use them to smuggle and trade smokeleaf to neighboring factions or whatever.
